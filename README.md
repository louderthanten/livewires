Live Wires
=========

A simple in-browser wireframing toolkit.

This is my answer to all the crappy wireframing tools and over-complicated prototype libraries out there.

Live Wires is simple HTML & CSS. It doesn't try to be fancy. It doesn't look like a final design, but it also doesn't look like dog doo like other wireframing tools. Most text is represented by background images. It is designed to be a starting point for production code, not something you throw out. It's also very fast to work with once you get the hang of it. It is more of a philosophy than a product.
